# Booking System

This is a full-stack web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to be an Airbnb clone with all the main functionalities.

As a continuous learner, this project is aimed at self-training to enhance and grow my skills. The project is quite extensive and includes functionalities from front-end to back-end.

To protect my API endpoints, I am using JWT. For more details about it, refer to the `client` folder > `README.md` file.

Images are saved on local storage, but they can also be saved in Azure Blob Storage as an option.

Clients must be authenticated against the database and authorized to access certain functionalities.

## Functional Requirements
